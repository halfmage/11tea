11tea (Eleventea) is a super simple starter to make website using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) which, all together are forming the new fancy TEA-Stack. Have some tea!

## Details

- **Favicons**: For the generation of social images and favicon files I used [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and adopted the file names of the exports so you can easily copy and replace those images

## Shoutouts

- [Greg Wolanski's TEA Starter](https://github.com/gregwolanski/eleventy-tailwindcss-alpinejs-starter) teached me a lot about setting up a eleventy starter in general and I liked the way he inlcuded a optimized tailwind css build without the need of webpack.
